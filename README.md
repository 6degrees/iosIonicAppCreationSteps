# iOS App Creation Steps through ionicFramework

INTRODUCTION
------------

This repository serves as personal notes on the steps required to create iOS
apps through ionicFramework.  
The steps are grouped as follows:
 * Development Steps
 * Provisioning Steps


 REQUIREMENTS
 ------------

 You will need the following to complete the task:
  * OpenSSL (to create CSRs and keys)
  * Development environment:
      * Ionic Creator Account (if you want to develop through the cloud) or
      * Simply install the following and start developing from your machine:
          * Node.JS
          * Ionic 1 (for JS support, ionic 2 is strictly TypeScript and most of us hate that)
          * Cordova (for native functions implementation)
  * Apple Developer Account ($99/yr) obviously to upload and test your application
  * Good text editor (Atom, Brackets, Notepad++)
  * Mac Machine (or Mac Virtual Machine ;)), to load your IPA into developer account
